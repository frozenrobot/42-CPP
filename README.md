Second piscine in the 42 curriculum, this time in C++!

Learned the ways of Object-Oriented Programming through a series of exercises on references/pointers, Ad-hoc polymorphism, overloads, orthodox canonical classes, inheritance, subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces, try/catch and exceptions, casts, templates and containers.
